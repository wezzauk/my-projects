          I'm  qualified acupuncturist thopugh I do not practise anymore. I had learned a system of acupuncture called balance acupuncture.
          The premise was that you could insert needles into specific meridians depending on the affected meridian and get near instant results!
        </p>
        <p>
          The approach is based on 6 systems and the meridian that needs to be treated depends on the meridian that is affected, or the 'sick' meridian. Once the sick meridian has been identified, the meridians used for treatment can chosen depending on the system the acupuncturist wishes to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made this app so the acupuncturist can simple identify the sick meridian and click on it. The app will then list the possible meridians that can be used to treat the condition.
