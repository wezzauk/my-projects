            <h1>100 Days of Code Challenge</h1>
            <p>In trying to learn to code and making slow progress, I decided to commit to the 100 days of code challenge.</p>
            <p>The aim of the challenge is to code for at least an hour each day. Whilst I didn't manage an hour each time, I did do some coding every day for 100 days!</p>
            <p>The challenge taught me that with persistence and consistency, even doing a little each day I can make great progress. As part of the challenge I created an Instagram account and posted daily to help with accountability. </p>

          <p>
            I started off learning Java as it seemed like a good generic language to start with. The whole of my 100 days of code challenge was done in Java. On completion I was able to make a simple program but realised that I had no idea how to make it into a functional app that others could use. I had many other things to learn before I could achieve this.
            <br><br>
            I have since made the decision to switch over to learning JavaScript.

              I'm a qualified acupuncturist though I don't practice now. I practised a form of acupuncture called balance acupuncture in which the treating meridian is calculated according to which meridian is affected or 'sick'.
              <br><br>
              I managed to make a simple app for calculating which meridian to treat by selecting the affected or 'sick' meridian.
